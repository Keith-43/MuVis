/**
 The AudioManager class handles the playing, capture, and processing of audio data in real time.
 This version of the AudioManager uses the BASS audio library from [un4seen](https://www.un4seen.com) .
 
 When this class is first run, it plays the song file named music.mp3 located in the app's bundle .  Pressing the "Select Song" button in the ContentView struct allows the user to change to any song file located on his device.  Also, pressing the "MicOn" button, changes the micEnabled variable to true, and causes this class to processes live audio data from the microphone.

 The input audio signal is sampled at 44,100 samples per second.
 Our FFT window of 16,384 samples has a duration of 16,384 / 44,100 = 0.37152 seconds.
 We calculate a new spectrum every 1/60 seconds (that is, 0.01666 seconds), hence our window overlap factor is (0.37152-0.016666)/0.37152 = 95%
 If we calculate a new spectrum every 1/20 seconds (that is, 0.05000 seconds), hence our window overlap factor is (0.37152-0.050000)/0.37152 = 86%
 If we calculate a new spectrum every 1/10 seconds (that is, 0.10000 seconds), hence our window overlap factor is (0.37152-0.100000)/0.37152 = 73%

 If the firing time is delayed so far that it passes one or more of the scheduled firing times, the timer is fired only once for that time period; the timer is then rescheduled, after firing, for the next scheduled firing time in the future.

 If the repeating Timer is scheduled to fire ever 17 msec, but the graphics task takes 20 msec, then it will fire at 0, 20, 34, 54, 68, 78
                                                                     difference:       20, 14, 20, 14, 20

 From Ian on 230327:  On most platforms, BASS can detect and use the device's current rate, and so the BASS_Init "freq" parameter has no effect on the output. An exception is on Linux, where the specified rate will be used if it's supported. It can also be applied on macOS/iOS (changing the device's current rate) with the BASS_DEVICE_FREQ flag. In all cases, BASS's actual output rate can be confirmed with BASS_GetInfo.

 A repeating timer reschedules itself automatically based on the scheduled firing time, not the actual firing time. For example, if a timer is scheduled to fire at a particular time and every 5 seconds after that, the scheduled firing time will always fall on the original 5 second time intervals, even if the actual firing time gets delayed. If the firing time is delayed so much that it misses one or more of the scheduled firing times, the timer is fired only once for the missed time period. After firing for the missed period, the timer is rescheduled for the next scheduled firing time.

 timer.invalidate()   This method is the only way to remove a timer from an RunLoop object. The RunLoop object removes its strong reference to the timer, either just before the invalidate() method returns or at some later point.  If it was configured with target and user info objects, the receiver removes its strong references to those objects as well.  You must send this message from the thread on which the timer was installed. If you send this message from another thread, the input source associated with the timer may not be removed from its run loop, which could prevent the thread from exiting properly.
